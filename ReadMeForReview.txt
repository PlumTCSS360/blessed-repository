	⦁ As a project manager, I can start a new project so that I can keep different projects organized and separate.
      	⦁ As a project manager, I can load an existing project so that I can review/edit the information inside of it.
	⦁ As a project manager, I can import and export data from project folder, and user info file.

       ⦁ Our UI uses BorderLayout to place New, Load, Export, and Import buttons in the South. I wonder if we can put these buttons a little more practical.

       ⦁ Our UI has a greeting message and buttons now. We would like to know how to improve the frame. For example, adding an About button to display information about contact information of developers or displaying a brief application introduction message.

       ⦁ We would like to know whether our UI of WelcomeFrame, NewFrame, or LoadFrame works properly on different resolutions. 

       ⦁ We would like to check that our javadoc comment briefly explains what the methods within the class work, and what the class does.

       ⦁ We would like to know whether the complex code in the method is described so that other developers can easily understand what it does within the methods.

       ⦁ We would like to know the good way to breakdown that LoadFrame() constructor in LoadFrame class such as separating features for creating buttons by creating method

       ⦁ Our NewFrame class will catch invalid input such as non numerical value and negative value. However, It can’t catch a positive value with more than two floating values such as 2000.1234. We wonder if it's appropriate for us to catch this wrong input. If we had to, we'd like to know how.
